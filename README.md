## Dimension Reduction Package
This package consists of several dimension reduction approaches for both normal data and image data.<br>

# Face recognition example
I use face recognition to show the importance of dimension reduction. Linear discriminant analysis is used in this project.
I use several linear discriminant analysis algorithms to reduce the dimension of the image data. Then I classify them by K-nearest neighbor
algorithm.
